    "A secondary harm that is somewhat unique to credit lending decisions is the long-term impact on an individual's credit score. In the United States, a [_FICO credit score_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) is a number between 300 and 850 that represents a customer's _creditworthiness_. An applicant's _credit score_ is used by many financial institutions for lending decisions. An applicant's _credit score_ usually increases after a successful repayment of a loan and decreases if the applicant fails to repay the loan.\n",

    " When applying for a credit loan, there are three major outcomes:\n",

    "1. The individual receives the credit loan and pays back the loan. In this scenario, we expect the individual's credit score to increase as a result of the successful repayment of the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The individual receives the credit loan but defaults on the loan. In this scenario, the individual's credit score will drop drastically due to the failure to repay the loan. In the modeling process, this outcome is tied to a **false negative** (the model predicts the individual will repay the loan, but the individual is unsuccessful in doing so).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In certain countries, such as the United States, an individual receives a small drop (up to five points) to their credit score after a lender performs a *hard inquiry* on the applicant's credit history. If the applicant applies for a loan but does not receive it, the small decrease in their credit score will impact their ability to successfully apply for a future loan. In the modeling process, this outcome is tied to the **selection rate** (the proportion of positive predictions outputted by the model)."

If this were a real model being developed a financial institution, the *balanced error score* would be a proxy for the profitability of the model. By maintaining a relatively similar *balanced error score*, we've produced a model that preserves profitability to the firm while producing more fair and equitable outcomes for women in this scenario."

    "When proving credit models are compliant with fair lending laws, practitoners may run into the issue of not having access to the sensitive demographic features. As a result, financial institutions are often tasked with proving their models are compliant with fair lending laws by imputing these demographics features. However, [Chen et. al (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11154) show these imputation methods often introduce new fairness-related issues."
